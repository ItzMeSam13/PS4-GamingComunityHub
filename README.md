## 🎯 Problem Statement  
<br>
PS4
<br>
The gaming world is huge—but gamers and organizers are still scattered across multiple platforms.  
Players are using one app to stream, another to chat, and a totally different one to find and join tournaments.  
There’s no single space where everything comes together, making it hard to connect, compete, and grow as a community.

## 🔍 What We Understood from the Problem Statement  
Gamers today are forced to juggle between platforms just to do what they love: play, compete, and connect.  
The experience is fragmented—there’s no unified hub for tournaments, team coordination, social interaction, or streaming.  
We aim to solve this by building one powerful, all-in-one platform for the eSports and gaming community.

## 🛠️ Our Approach / How We Plan to Solve It  
1. **Backend Setup** – Build a RESTful API using Node.js and Express, with Supabase for authentication and data storage.  
2. **Database Design** – Create structured tables for users, teams, tournaments, chats, and posts in Supabase.  
3. **Authentication** – Use Supabase Auth to allow players to sign up with email or social logins (e.g., Discord, Twitch).  
4. **Tournament System** – Develop features to create, register, manage, and track tournaments easily.  
5. **Real-Time Features** – Implement live chat and notifications using Supabase Realtime.  
6. **Frontend Development** – Use Next.js for a fast, dynamic frontend experience.  
7. **Design** – Design sleek UI/UX with Figma before implementing in code.  
8. **Role-Based Access** – Add middleware to distinguish between players, organizers, and admins.  
9. **Smooth Navigation** – Focus on intuitive flows for key actions like joining a team or registering for an event.
